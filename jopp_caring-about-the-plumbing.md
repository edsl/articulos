1. Introduction
---------------

Introducción
------------

“Peer-to-peer is plumbing, and most people don’t care about plumbing,”
pointed out some years ago Dan Bricklin, the father of the first
spreadsheet VisiCalc, in a seminal book about peer-to-peer (P2P)
technology’s potential as a “disruptive” technology (Bricklin, 2001 in
Oram, 2001, p. 59). The “most people” Bricklin refers to in this
citation are, of course, end users of the popular first-generation P2P
file-sharing applications, like Napster, that were experiencing their
hour of glory at the dawn of the 21st century.

"El P2P es plomería y la mayor parte de la gente no se preocupa por la
plomería", notó hace unos años Dan Bricklin, el padre de la primer planilla de
cálculos VisiCalc en un libro seminal sobre el potencial "disruptivo" de la
tecnología de pares (P2P)[@bricklin-2001, @oram-2001 p.59].  La "mayor parte de
la gente" a la que se refiere Bricklin en esta cita son, por supuesto, los
usuarios finales de las populares aplicaciones de compartición de archivos P2P
de primera generación, como Napster, que experimentaban su hora de gloria en el
amanecer del siglo XXI.

Indeed, Bricklin may have been right in his assessment of the first P2P
file-sharing applications’ success: likely, it owes more to the
suitability of such tools to rapidly find a song and obtain it, than to
their underlying peer-to-peer architecture in itself. Yet, this argument
raises new and interesting methodological questions for scholars of
social studies of networking technologies, be they used for
communication, sharing, or production purposes. To what extent may
Bricklin’s perception of indifference towards architecture apply not
only to a majority of users of Internet-based services, but to these
scholars, as well – and why, instead, it is important for them to
“care”?

En efecto, Bricklin puede haber estado en lo cierto en su aserción sobre el
éxito de las primeras aplicaciones P2P:  se debía probablemente a la capacidad
de tales herramientas para encontrar rápidamente una canción y descargarla, que
a la arquitectura de pares subyacente.  Este argumento genera nuevas e
interesantes preguntas metodológicas para los estudios sociales de las
tecnologías de red, sean estas utilizadas para la comunicación, compartición o
producción.  ¿Hasta qué punto la percepción de Bricklin sobre la indiferencia
hacia la arquitectura se aplica no sólo a la mayoría de los usuarios de
servicios de Internet, sino también a estos académicos y por qué resulta
importante que les "importe"?

This article discusses the relevance, for scholars working on social
studies of network media, of addressing elements of application
architecture and design as an integral part of their subject of study.
By discussing an ongoing research on “alternative” or “legitimate”
(Verma, 2004) applications of P2P networking models, the article argues
that social studies of network media need to “care about the plumbing,”
or as Susan Leigh Star has effectively put it, “surface invisible work”
(1999, p. 385) underlying networked practices, uses and exchanges – as
an integral part of the “processes of constitution, organization, and
change of […] the network society” (Castells, 2000, p. 693).

Este artículo discute la relevancia, para los académicos trabajando en estudios
sociales de medios de red, de abordar elementos de la arquitectura y diseño de
aplicaciones como parte integral de su tema de estudio.  Al discutir las
investigaciones en curso sobre aplicaciones "alternativas" o
"legítimas"[@verma-2004] de los modelos de redes de pares, el artículo
argumenta que los estudios sociales de medios de red necesitan "preocuparse por
la plomería", o como Susan Leigh Star ha efectivamente dicho, "traer a la
superficie el trabajo invisible"[@leigh-1999 p. 385] subyacente a las
prácticas, usos e intercambios de red --como parte integral de los "procesos de
constitución, organización y cambio de [...] la sociedad red".
[@castells-2000 p. 693]

In doing so, the article proposes to acknowledge how Internet-based
services’ current trajectories of innovation increasingly suggest that
particular forms of distribution and decentralization (or their lack),
impact specific procedures, practices and uses. As Barbara van Schewick
has recently suggested, architectures should be understood an
“alternative way of influencing economic systems” (2010, p. 3), indeed,
the very fabric of user behavior and interaction. Most notably, the
status of every Internet user as a consumer, a sharer, a producer and
possibly a manager of digital content is informed by, and shapes in
return, the technical structure and organization of the services (s)he
has access to: their mandatory passage points, places of storage and
trade, required intersections. This article is a call to study the
architecture of networking applications as a “relational property, not
as a thing stripped of use” (Star & Ruhleder, 1996, p. 113), “as part of
human organization, and as problematic as any other” (Star, 2002, p.
116). It suggests that such an approach provides an added value to the
study of those communities, groups and practices that, by leveraging
socio-technical dynamics of distribution, decentralization,
collaboration and peer production, are currently questioning more
traditional or institutionalized models of content creation, search and
sharing.

Al hacerlo, el artículo propone reconocer cómo las trayectorias corrientes de
innovación de los servicios basados en Internet sugieren cada vez más que
formas particulares de distribución y decentralización (o la falta de),
impactan sobre procedimientos, prácticas y usos específicos.  Como ha sugerido
recientemente Barbara van Schewick, las arquitecturas deben entenderse como una
"forma alternativa de influenciar sistemas económicos"[@schewick-2010 p. 3], y
en efecto como la trama misma del comportamiento y la interacción de los
usuarios.  Notablemente, el estatus de todo usuario de Internet como
consumidor, compartidor, productor y posiblemente administrador de contenido
digital está informado y formado por la estructura y organización técnica de
esos servicios a los que accede: sus puntos de pasos mandatorios, los lugares
de almacenamiento e intercambio, las intersecciones requeridas.  Este artículo
es una llamada a estudiar la arquitectura de las aplicaciones de red como una
"propiedad relacional, no una cosa despojada de uso", 
[@star-ruhleder-1996 p. 113] "como parte de la organización humana y tan
problemática como cualquier otra"[@star-2002 p. 116].  Sugiere que un abordaje
tal provee un valor agregado al estudio de estas comunidades, grupos y
prácticas que aprovechando las dinámicas sociotécnicas de distribución,
decentralización, colaboración y producción de pares, están actualmente
cuestionando modelos más tradicionales o institucionalizados de creación de
contenido, búsqueda y compartición.

2. Architectures, fieldwork and methods: fleshing out the invisible
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The architecture of a network or an application is its underlying
technical structure (van Schewick, 2010), designed according to a
“matrix of concepts” (Agre, 2003): its logical and structural layout,
consisting of transmission equipment, communication protocols,
infrastructure, and connectivity between its components or nodes.[1] The
choice of taking architectures, artifacts transparent to end users by
fiat of their creators, as the starting point – or at least as an
important and integral part – of a study of practices and uses with
network media raises a number of challenges, as well as great promise.

As Barbara van Schewick points out, the compartmentalization of
disciplines may have led in the past to a general understanding of
architectures as artifacts that are “relevant only to engineers”, and as
such, should be exclusively left to their purview (2010, p. 2). However,
in relation to network media, software, code and cyberinfrastructure
studies have recently taken up the challenge of interdisciplinarity
(e.g. Fuller, 2008), drawing on past endeavours in the field of
sociology of technology and science, exploring the social and political
qualities of infrastructures (e.g. Star, 1999). In addition, some
authors experimenting at the intersection of computer science,
sociology, law and science & technology studies (STS) explore innovative
methodological approaches to architectures, working on the integration
of architectures and practices in their analyses. These bodies of work
will now be addressed in some more detail.

**2.1. Disciplines and layers**\
 Literature in computer science and computer engineering has, perhaps
quite obviously, paid a great deal of attention to architectures of
Internet-based applications and networks: their definition (Schollmeier,
2002; Schoder & Fischbach, 2003 ; Shirky et al., 2001), their technical
advantages and disadvantages in a comparative perspective (e.g.
client/server vs. peer-to-peer architectures, Verma, 2004, p. 11-16) and
their application to specific projects serving a variety of uses (Oram,
2001, p. 67-159); these “purely” technical aspects of such systems are
seldom addressed in relation to their societal, relational and
organizational properties (Taylor & Harrison, 2009, p. 113-115). In some
cases of highly publicized, debated applications – as it has been the
case for some P2P systems – engineers have at times sought to present a
technical perspective on the limits and advantages of specific
architectures within at-large political and public debates (Auber, 2007;
Le Fessant, 2006, 2009). Other scholars, interested in the metrology of
networks, seek to model interactions by means of large-scale graphs, so
as to study patterns of information propagation, the robustness of
networks, the forms of exchange and sharing (e.g. Aidouni et al., 2009).
Their aim is to build measuring tools that are better adapted to the
ever-increasing size and complexity of networks, and more able to face
the increasing inadequacy of traditional statistical and sampling
methods to account for the magnitude of this scaling process (Baccelli,
2005).

On the other hand, as of today, an important number of works in economic
and social sciences has sought to explore the practices of sharing,
cooperation and interaction facilitated or enabled by online
environments: it is the case of many contributions exploring new forms
of organization, contribution and collaboration, like social networks
(e.g. Boyd, 2004; Cardon, 2008) or online communities (Auray, 2011), be
they composed of fans (Hellekson & Busse, 2006), contributors to wiki
projects (Reagle, 2010), or specialized professionals (Lock, 2006).

The body of work on the law of network technologies has extensively
addressed, on its hand – again, perhaps unsurprisingly – the dynamics of
file-sharing practices by means of direct-exchange networking
technologies, and has focused the debate on the ways in which innovative
networking practices may be assimilated, by analogy, to mechanisms of
remuneration and compensation similar to those in place for material,
private copies (e.g. Gasser & Ernst, 2006). As pointed out by Mélanie
Dulong de Rosnay (2005, 2007), as of now, only a comparatively small
number of works has been devoted to the ways in which law can take into
account the objects and sources of value (such as metadata and personal
data) produced by new technical configurations.

**2.2. Towards an integration of architectures and practices: the STS
legacy\
**Some examples in recent literature open very interesting paths by
undertaking the next step in the experimentation with
interdisciplinarity. These authors, coming from a variety of different
backgrounds, approach architectures in innovative ways by integrating
the link between architectures and practices in their analyses.

Perhaps the most notable attempt in this direction is constituted by the
work, carried out during the last fifteen years by Susan Leigh Star and
colleagues within the field of STS, on infrastructures as constantly
evolving socio-technical systems, informed not only by physical elements
invisible to the end user, but also by factors such as social
organization and knowledge sharing (Star & Ruhleder, 1996; Neumann &
Star, 1996; Star, 1999; Star, 2002; Star & Bowker, 2006) Through her
“call to study boring things,” Star effectively conveys the idea that
architectural design choices, technical specifications, standards and
number sequences are no less important to the study of information
systems because they are “hidden mechanisms subtending those processes
more familiar to social scientists” (Star, 1999, p. 337). As she writes
in a seminal article on the ethnography of infrastructure:

It takes some digging to unearth the dramas inherent in system design
creating, to restore narrative to what appears to be dead lists. […]
Much of the ethnographic study of information systems implicitly
involves the study of infrastructure. Struggles with infrastructure are
built into the very fabric of technical work […]. However, it is easy to
stay within the traditional purview of field studies: talk, community,
identity, and group processes, as now mediated by information
technology. […] Study an information system and neglect its standards,
wires, and settings, and you miss equally essential aspects of
aesthetics, justice, and change (Star, 1999, p. 337-339).

This “relational” approach brings about considerable changes in methods,
as the scope of the fieldwork enlarges to include arenas where the
shapes of architecture and infrastructure are observed, deconstructed,
reconstructed, and decisions are made about codes, standards,
bricolages, reconfigurations (Star & Bowker, 2006, p. 151-152), where
the scholar undertakes a combination of “historical and literary
analysis, traditional tools like interviews and observations, systems
analysis, and usability studies” (Star, 1999, p. 382).

Emergent bodies of work such as software studies, critical code studies
and cyberinfrastructure studies (Manovich, 2001; Fuller, 2008; Marino,
2006; Ribes & Lee, 2010) owe a lot to the STS approach, seeking, as Matt
Kirschenbaum (2003) puts it, to balance “the deployment of critical
terms like ‘virtuality’ […with] a commitment to meticulous documentary
research to recover and stabilize the material traces of new media”. The
materiality of software, code, and so-called virtual elements of the
Internet user’s experience is reaffirmed, and the relationship between
these layers (or “levels”, as defined by Mark Marino) explored:

Meaning grows out of the functioning of the code but is not limited to
the literal processes the code enacts. Through CCS, practitioners may
critique the larger human and computer systems,from the level of the
computer to the level of the society in which these code objects
circulate and exert influence (Marino, 2006).

**2.3. Architectures: social, legal, political\
**On the side of computational and quantitative sociology, David Hales
and colleagues seek to explore features of particular groupings that he
calls “virtual tribes”, such as dynamic formation and dissolution
overtime, cooperation, specialization, reputation systems, and
occasional antagonist behavior; he considers that a thorough
understanding of such phenomena is a necessary precondition for the
construction of robust and resilient software systems, both today and in
the future (Hales, 2006; Marcozzi & Hales, 2008; Hales, Arteconi,
Marcozzi & Chao, 2008).

Information studies scholar and Internet pioneer Philip Agre explores on
his side the relationship between technical architecture and
institutions, notably the difference between “architecture as politics”
and “architecture as a substitute for politics” (Agre, 2003). He argues
that technologies “often come wrapped in stories about politics”, and
while these stories may not explain the motives of the technologists,
they are indeed useful to account for the energy that makes a technology
an inherently social one, and projects it into the larger world (p. 39).
Defining architectures as the matrixes of concepts (e.g. the distinction
between clients and servers) designed into technology, and institutions
as the matrixes of concepts that organize language, rules, job titles,
and other social categories in particular societal sectors, Agre
suggests that the engineering story of rationally distributed
computation and the political story of institutional change through
decentralized architecture are not naturally related. They reconfigure
and evolve constantly, and for these reconfigurations and evolutions to
share a common direction, they need work:

Decentralized institutions do not imply decentralized architectures, or
vice versa. The drive toward decentralized architectures need not serve
the political purpose of decentralizing society. Architectures and
institutions inevitably coevolve, and to the extent they can be
designed, they should be designed together. […] Radically improved
information and communication technologies do open new possibilities for
institutional change. To explore those possibilities, though,
technologists will need better ideas about institutions (Agre, 2003, p.
42).

At the crossroads of informatics, economics and law, Barbara van
Schewick has recently put forward the idea that the architecture of the
Internet, and of the applications running on it, is relevant to
economics. Her work seeks to examine how changes, notably design
choices, in the Internet’s architecture (that she defines operationally
as the “underlying technical structure” of the network of networks)
affect the economic environment for innovation, and evaluates the impact
of these changes from the perspective of public policy (2010, p. 2).
According to van Schewick, this is a first step towards filling a gap in
how scholarship understands innovators’ decisions to innovate and the
economic environment for innovation: after many years of research on
innovation processes, we understand how these are affected by changes in
laws, norms, and prices; yet, we lack a similar understanding of how
architecture and innovation impact each other (p. 2-3). Perhaps, van
Schewick suggests, this is due to the intrinsic appeal of architectures
as purely technical systems:

Just as the architecture of a house describes its basic inner structure,
the architecture of a complex system describes the basic inner structure
of the system — its components, what they do, and how they interact to
provide the system’s functionality. That such a technical structure may
have economic consequences at all is a relatively recent insight. Most
people still think of architectures as technical artifacts that are
relevant only to engineers. Thus, understanding how the Internet’s
architecture affects innovation requires us to think more generally
about how architectures affect innovation (van Schewick, 2010, p. 4).

Traditionally, she concludes, policy makers have used the law to bring
about desired economic effects. Architecture de facto constitutes an
alternative way of influencing economic systems, and as such, it is
becoming another tool that actors can use to further their interests (p.
389).

Along the same lines, within a large-scale project investigating how the
corpus of Requests for Comments (RFCs) of the Internet Engineering Task
Force provides indications on the ways in which the Internet’s technical
designers understood and engaged with law and policy issues, Sandra
Braman has most recently (2011) explored how the core problem in the
Internet’s technical design was to build structures that not only
tolerated, but actually facilitated change. By addressing the ways in
which change and stability themselves were conceptualized by Internet
designers, Braman argues that undertaking research on architectural «
design for instability » as applied to the Internet provides insight not
only into the Internet itself, but into its social, legal and technical
relations with other information and communication technologies (ICTs).

Drawing on pioneering works such as those of Yochai Benkler on sharing
as a paradigm of economic production in its own right (2004) and of
Lawrence Lessig on “code as law” (2002), the relationship between
architecture and law is further explored by Niva Elkin-Koren (2002,
2006); a common trait of her works is its underlying perspective on
architecture as a dynamic parameter, and she treats it as such while
studying the reciprocal influences of law and technology design in
information and communication systems. Elkin-Koren argues that the
interrelationship between law and technology often focuses on one single
aspect, the challenges that emerging technologies pose to the existing
legal regime, thereby creating a need for further legal reform; thus,
she notes how juridical measures involving technology both as a target
of regulation and as a means of enforcement should take into account
that the law does not merely respond to new technologies, but also
shapes them and may affect their design (Elkin-Koren, 2006).

3. What architecture for the future Internet (-based services)?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Internet’s current trajectories of innovation are making it
increasingly evident by the day: the evolutions (and in-volutions) of
the “network of networks”, and at a broader level of electronic
communications, are likely to depend in the medium-to-long term on the
topology and the organizational/technical model of Internet-based
applications, as well as on the infrastructure underlying them (Aigrain,
2011).

The development of services based on distributed architectures is
currently affirming itself as one of the Internet’s most important axes
of transformation. The concept of distribution is somehow shaped and
inscribed into the very beginnings of the Internet – notably in the
organization and circulation of information fluxes – but its current
topology integrates this structuring principle only in very limited ways
(Minar & Hedlund, 2001). The limits of the “classic” urbanism of the
Internet, which has been predominant since the beginning of its
commercial era and its appropriation by the masses, are becoming evident
with regards to phenomena such as the widespread success of social media
(Schafer, Le Crosnier & Musiani, 2011). While Internet users have
become, at least potentially, not only consumers but also distributors,
sharers and producers of digital content, the network of networks is
structured in such a way that large quantities of data are centralized
and compressed within specific regions of the Internet, at the same time
when they are most suited to a rapid re-diffusion and re-sharing in
multiple locations of a network that has now reached its full
globalization.

**3.1. Architectures and the Internet’s “social value”**\
 The current organization of Internet-based services and the structure
of the network that enables their functioning, with its mandatory
passage points, places of storage and trade, required intersections,
raises many questions, both in terms of the optimized utilization of
storage resources, and of the fluidity, rapidity and effectiveness of
electronic exchanges. Other interrogations, on the security of exchanges
and on the stability of the network, must also be added to these issues:
a series of malfunctions and breakdowns with important consequences at
the global level [2] draw our attention on questions of security and
data protection, inherent to the Internet’s current structure.

These questions impact largely the balance of powers between users and
network providers, and reach questions of net neutrality. To what extent
can network providers interfere with specific uses? Can the network be
optimized for specific uses? As Barbara van Schewick points out, by
enabling users to use the Internet in the way that creates the most
value for them, changes in architecture are not only likely to impact
the value of the Internet for users, but also to increase or diminish
the Internet’s overall value to society:

But the social value of architectures […] goes beyond that. The Internet
has the potential to enhance individual freedom, provide a platform for
better democratic participation, foster a more critical and
self-reﬂective culture, and potentially improve human development
everywhere. The Internet’s ability to realize this potential, however,
is tightly linked to features — user choice, non-discrimination,
non-optimization (van Schewick, 2010, p. 387),

that may be achieved in different ways by designing its underlying
architecture in different ways. Resorting to decentralized architectures
and distributed organizational forms, then, constitutes a different way
to address some issues of management of the network, in a perspective of
effectiveness, security and digital “sustainable development” (better
resource management), and of maximization of its value to society.

This idea is further explored by Michel Bauwens (2005) who, proposing a
vision of the P2P model that is based on but goes beyond computer
technology, puts forward a P2P theory as a “general theory” of
collaborative and direct human interaction, an emerging, pervasive and
inherently social phenomenon that may be profoundly transforming the way
in which society and human civilization is organised.

**3.2. The peer-to-peer model: a return to the past, a promise for the
future**\
 Since the inception of the Internet, the principle of decentralization
has governed the circulation of transmissions and communications on the
“network of networks” (Aigrain, 2011). However, the introduction of the
World Wide Web in 1990 has progressively and widely led to the diffusion
of “client-server” architecture models; the most widespread and diffused
Internet-based services (social networks, instant messaging tools,
digital content storage services…) are based upon technical and economic
models in which end users ask for information, data, services to “farms”
of powerful servers, stocking information and/or managing network
traffic (van Schewick, 2010, p. 70). Even if traffic on the Internet
functions on the generalized distribution principle, it has now taken
the form of concentration around servers delivering access to content.
Yet, this modality of organization for structure and services, in and on
the network, is not the only possible one – and while being the most
widespread, it is maybe not the most effective. Thus, the search for
alternatives is currently in progress (Aigrain, 2010, 2011; Moglen,
2010).

Peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture is reclaiming its place among these
alternatives. It is a computer network model structured in such a way
that communications and/or exchanges take place between nodes having the
same responsibility within the system. The dichotomy between server
(provider of the service) and client(s) (requesters of the service),
typical of the client-server model, is replaced by a situation where
every client becomes a server as well, where all peers have a resource
and all peers request it (Schollmeier, 2002).

The P2P model is not per se innovative in the history of the Internet.
Indeed, the original Internet was fundamentally designed as a
peer-to-peer system, before the network started being populated by an
ever-increasing number of end users, and became the device through which
millions of consumer clients communicated with a “relatively privileged”
set of servers (Minar & Hedlund, 2001, p. 4). Yet, as the quantity and
quality of bandwidth increased, home computers became more powerful, and
domestic users progressively diversified their activities beyond
browsing the Web and trading emails, the conditions were set for another
change – or, perhaps, a reversion, with “machines in the home and on the
desktop are connecting to each other directly, forming groups and
collaborating to become user-created search engines, virtual
supercomputers, and file systems”. So, while noticing the “many specific
problems where the Internet architecture has been strained”, application
developers often find themselves looking back to the Internet of twenty
years ago when considering how best to solve a problem (Minar & Hedlund,
2001, p. 3; Figueiredo et al., 2008).

P2P architecture embraces the decentralization principle by harnessing
the network in a different way than client-server applications. In this
architecture, users ask for services to a cluster of servers of limited
capacity; unless there is the possibility to add further servers at any
time, a critical point in data transmission for and to all users may be
eventually reached depending on additional clients joining the network
(and, in extreme conditions, turn into denial-of-service situations). In
P2P architecture, users are not only exploiting a resource (be it
bandwidth, storage space, computing power) but are providing it, as well
– so that, if the request to which the system must respond augments, the
total capacity of the system increases, too. P2P systems may also
present advantages in terms of stability and endurance, as the
distributed nature of the system improves its overall strength and
avoids its complete invalidation in case one of the nodes fails to
perform as expected or disconnects from the system. Indeed, the
effectiveness of P2P as a distribution model is strictly linked to its
“plumbing”: the repartition of computing power and bandwidth among all
components of the system, which changes the distributive structure and
the allotment of costs by increasing bandwidth use at the level of the
network, not of the server(s) (Elkin-Koren, 2006, p. 21-23).

In the course of their relatively short history, P2P systems have often
been considered as a threat to the interests of the industries of
digital content, as their main use by the public has been the
unauthorized sharing of materials covered by intellectual property
rights, notably copyright. More specifically, this reputation has been
forged in the first years 2000, with the advent of exchange and sharing
practices at the global scale, concerning millions of users – the most
emblematic case being that of Napster and its sixty millions of sharers,
a service functioning on a centralized P2P architectural model, that was
shortly followed by hybrid and purely decentralized versions. Shortly
after the explosion of these “renewed” P2P technologies, attempts have
also been made to find economic models promoting this means of exchange
within the current legal framework, but they have generally proven
unsatisfactory [3].

The crucial role that such considerations have had in shaping the
controversial status of P2P technologies vis-à-vis the media and the
public may have led researchers to some pitfalls, as well. A
reductionist interpretation of the “P2P effect”, often underplayed as a
proxy for illegality, should be avoided – a perspective that is
particularly evident, Niva Elkin-Koren remarks (2006), in the juridical
literature on P2P and law. Also, social scientists should watch out for
the traps that P2P, a model with strong a priori connotations of
equality and decentralization, may set up. As noted by Philip Agre, it
is particularly easy in the case of P2P to juxtapose architecture to the
stories of institutions, individuals and groups, assuming that one
determines the other – but this may lead to a misleading shortcut:

In the case of P2P technologies, the official engineering story is that
computational effort should be distributed to reflect the structure of
the problem. But the engineering story does not explain the strong
feelings P2P computing often evokes. The strong feelings derive from a
political story, often heatedly disavowed by technologists but
widespread in the culture: P2P delivers on the Internet’s promise of
decentralization. By minimizing the role of centralized computing
elements, the story goes, P2P systems will be immune to censorship,
monopoly, regulation, and other exercises of centralized authority. This
juxtaposition of engineering and politics is common enough, and for an
obvious reason: engineered artifacts such as the Internet are embedded
in society in complicated ways […] the case of P2P computing (is good)
to analyze the relationship between engineering and politics—or, as I
want to say, between architectures and institutions. […] The P2P
movement understands that architecture is politics, but it should not
assume that architecture is a substitute for politics (Agre, 2003, p.
39-42).

P2P-based socio-technical systems may be better analyzed and understood
with an approach that addresses, studies, explores architecture as the
very fabric of those interactions and examines how these shape, in
return, subsequent negotiations and redesigns of the system. Scholars
interested in networking technologies of communication and exchange need
to “learn to read these invisible layers of control and access. In order
to understand how this operates, however, it is necessary to
‘deconstruct’ the boring, backstage parts […], to disembed the
narratives it contains and the behind-the-scenes decisions […], as part
of material information science culture” (Star, 2002, p.110).

4. When architectures matter: the many faces of P2P systems
-----------------------------------------------------------

This article has sought to discuss the relevance, for social scientists
interested in network media and systems, of paying analytical attention
to elements of application architecture and design, as a core feature of
their subject of study. In particular, by discussing P2P technology as a
technical networking model and a dynamic of social interaction that are
inextricably intertwined, it has endeavored to illustrate the potential
and challenges of this approach when addressing issues of transformation
and sustainability of the current Internet model. While the primary
purpose of the article has been to discuss the foundations of a
methodological perspective, and not to delve into the field by its means
[4], this last section introduces – as both a conclusion and an overture
– some elements on how I have actually taken architectures into account
in my methodology when addressing an often underplayed, yet promising
area of innovation within the field of Internet-based services: that of
“alternative” or “legitimate” applications of peer-to-peer networks.

**4.1. “Alternative” P2P and Internet-based services**\
 A critical examination of different models of technical architectures,
in terms of their impact on Internet-based cooperation and production
practices – a better understanding of what the “plumbing” is about –
makes it possible to single out a growing number of P2P applications,
under-represented and somewhat hidden by the media buzz and the trials
engendered by the illegal sharing of musical files (Laflaquière, 2005).

In recent years, mostly since 2004, many projects and applications have
seen the light, that propose alternatives – built on decentralized or
P2P-based architectures – to Web-based online services occupying an
important place in the daily life of Internet users. The uses entailed
by such tools include information search and retrieval, sharing, and
communication. Thus, these projects are positioning themselves with
respect to services proposed by actors every Internet user is well
acquainted with, such as Google, Facebook, Picasa. By harnessing the
potential of P2P and of decentralization, the developers of such
projects aim at satisfying the same needs from the point of view of the
end user (who continues to search keywords, network with friends, share
pictures with them), but building the application on a different
architectural model or technical platform. A move that has potentially
long-reaching implications vis-à-vis the service provider’s status, its
access to information, and the material locations in which storage and
sharing operations of user-created content are conducted.

The analysis of how the integration of architecture and practices is
enacted in “alternative” P2P applications appears especially useful when
studying up-and-coming experiments with the decentralization of storage
and search services with a social networking component. This
investigation has been at the core of my PhD dissertation, currently in
the writing phase, parts of which have been published in previous papers
(Musiani, 2010a, 2010b, 2011). These applications reveal their
specificities with respect to both their centralized counterparts
(serving the same purpose, but underlying a different architecture) and
file-sharing P2P networks. The attention to the “plumbing” allows to
delve into dynamics of articulation between local and global dimensions
in a distributed application; of sharing of disk space and bandwidth as
the cornerstone of a socio-economic model for P2P; of deployment of
technical uncertainty and social opportunity at the “edges” of the
network, where under-utilized resources, both human and material, can be
leveraged.

**4.2. A pragmatic approach to P2P architectures**\
 Thus, the elaboration of case studies on “alternative” P2P applications
– when it becomes an exploration of the ways and means in which the
opportunity of change is constituted with P2P – entails a plural
approach, that follows on one hand the innovators, trying to identify
their strategies in the construction of the technologies, as well as
their valors, cultures and imaginaires of reference, and on the other
hand, the role played, where possible, by the first users of the
systems. The objective is threefold: retracing and breaking down, in
developers’ and users’ narratives, the actions and dynamics that
represent at once P2P technology and the changes it purports; following,
by means of onsite and online ethnography, how P2P innovators manage the
economic, political and social “relapses” of technical changes
development processes; tracing how discussions and controversies that
take place on technical forums between developers and users, and among
users themselves, progressively shape directions of mobilization for and
by means of P2P.

For all these reasons, it proves useful to avoid considering “P2P” as a
pre-defined object. Adopting a pragmatic approach, the starting point
for the fieldwork becomes the observation that, in the ICTs domain,
currently exists a variety of research projects and applications that,
in different manners and for different purposes, take up with a “P2P
technology” that is defined in a transversal way as a decentralised,
legal, private, social and user-centered alternative. A name and five
adjectives that become the entry points into the fieldwork, of which to
observe the (re)configurations and (re)compositions in the hands of the
actors and the shaping of the systems.\
 An empirical inquiry carried out by means of this approach helps
identifying “live”, and in a manner transversal to the different cases,
uses and technologies “in the making” (Callon, 1987; Callon & Latour,
1990), trying to obtain a common vision of the directions of
appropriation of P2P technologies. What I have called a “real-time
sociology of innovation”, with which I have experimented during my PhD,
proves a viable method to apprehend variable, multi-dimensional
situations, and attempt to draw some conclusions on their possible
developments and applications. At the same time, there is a need to
address the more ideological and utopian dimension of these
“alternatives” – that which speaks of an Internet ideal of
decentralization and autonomy – that is taken as a subject of inquiry,
to try and show how it leads to ways of doing things, explains choices,
validates assumptions. Along these lines, and once again following an
STS-based tradition, the observation of transformations, passages,
negotiations, modifications of objects, and of the moments where these
are put on “trial” beyond the scheduled phases of development, are of
special importance.

A particularly stimulating aspect of this approach is the consideration
of how law and rights take shape with the P2P alternative, in the
pursuit of three objectives. Firstly, in order to successfully define
the “legality” of such services, strictly linked to their constantly
evolving architecture that is often only partially accounted for in
written juridical documents. Secondly, to try and give instruments of
analysis able to rise above a conception of the relationship between law
and technology that all too often focuses on one aspect: the fact that
emerging technologies pose challenges to existing legal regimes,
creating a need for reform of these regimes. Thirdly, so that the
objects and the resources enabling P2P, and being produced by P2P, may
be fully conceived and treated as means of definition and protection of
the rights of users of Internet-based services.\
 In short, the acknowledgment of the importance of architectures calls,
in the specific case of the study of “alternative” P2P for
Internet-based services, for a process of methodological readjustment.
It implies delving into the technical functioning of direct transmission
of data between machines of a decentralized network, perhaps including
mechanisms of file fragmentation, encryption and maintenance, and take
it as a core feature (even if not necessarily the cause) of the types of
exchanges taking place within a service, of their effectiveness, of
their directness. It implies addressing the total or partial removal of
technical “intermediaries” (Elkin-Koren, 2006) in online networking and
sharing activities, as a structuring dynamic in new-generation
participative instruments. It means understanding where in the “fringes
and materialities of infrastructures” (Star, 2002, p. 107) a password is
stored, a file is indexed and encrypted, a download starts and ends, so
as to understand how new dynamics for the protection of personal
liberties and rights are taking hold – or are endangered. In short,
learning to read the “invisible layers” of P2P-based socio-technical
systems is as much a challenge as it is an opportunity to explore
collaborative practices carried out in, on and through them, and to
observe how these practices in-form the architecture in return, the
sharing of resources it entails, its medium- and long-term
socio-technical sustainability.

However, in a connected world where more applications than ever want to
use the network, send packets, consume bandwidth – thereby placing new
strains and tensions on the Internet’s architecture – social scientists
need to accept the challenge just as much as the technical people who
are working on the future topology of the “network of networks”. It is,
likely, one of the most promising ways to shed new light on dynamics of
content creation, sharing, publishing and management, that are shaping,
and being shaped by, the future Internet – one of the best ways to
contribute to its future sustainability.

5. Conclusions. The “lower layers”, a key for the sociology of networks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

“Caring about the plumbing”; “[f]inding the invisible work […] in the
traces left behind by coders, designers, and users of systems” (Star,
1999); the inclusion of the lower layers in the analysis – this article
has wished to suggest – means doing a sociology of networks that is not
afraid of its subject of study.

A consequence of this approach is a specific attention to an aspect of
networks that is not only very discreet, but even invisible to the eyes
of the users: their architecture. Of course, we remain social
scientists: this interest in architectures derives from the hypothesis
that particular forms of distribution call for specific procedures,
particular uses, peculiar “user portraits”. In doing so, one is able to
flesh out how some attributes of technology, of which users often lack a
direct knowledge or awareness, are bound to fully influence and inform
issues that are often crucial for uses and practices, such as the
treatment and physical location of data, the management of computing
resources, the shape and results of their queries to search engines.

In the specific context of P2P, this article is also an invitation to
further pursue the renovation of academic (and political) debates on
what are currently very lively, but “alternative”, processes of content
creation, search and sharing. Considering the architectural dimension
helps to overcome today’s prevailing paradigm when taking P2P as a
subject of study, that which, even when it focuses on forms of
organization in or by means of P2P dynamics, opts for a reduction of P2P
to the uses it entails and makes possible, one among them in
particular.\
 The link between the ways in which P2P applications take shape –
notably evolutions of their technical architecture – and their possible
influences on practices, relations and rights still remains quite
under-explored. Yet, the shaping of links, nodes, mandatory transit
points, information propagation protocols – in one word, their
architecture – tell us social scientists many things about the
specificities and promises of P2P-based applications, the challenges
they face, the opportunities they may present for the medium-term
evolution of the Internet model.

[1] The IEEE Standard for Architectural Description of
Software-Intensive Systems (IEEE P1471/D5.3) defines [technical]
architecture as ‘the fundamental organization of a system embodied by
its components, their relationships to each other and to the environment
and the principles guiding its design and evolution’ (Bredemayer &
Malan, 2001).

[2] E.g., respectively, Twitter’s repeated outages and the controversy
over the service’s long-term sustainability (see Pingdom, 2007: Twitter
had about six fully days of downtime in 2007, due to server overload and
the service’s failure to scale according to user demand), and the 2008
worldwide YouTube paralysis (see Bortzmeyer, 2008: the lack of access to
the popular video streaming website was due to a massive routing of BGP
requests by Pakistan Telecom, aimed at blocking the diffusion of some
contents in the country).

[3] As is the case for “Peer Impact”, a 2005-born pay-for-download file
sharing service running on a BitTorrent-like peer-to-peer distributions
system while maintaining centralized control of verification and
authorization of downloads.

[4] Something I attempt to do in other venues: see Musiani 2010 and
2011.
